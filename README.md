SROMPy - **S**tochastic **R**educed **O**rder **M**odels with **Py**thon 
==========================================================================

Python module for generating Stochastic Reduced Order Models (SROMs) and applying them for uncertainty quantification problems. See documentation in `docs/` directory for details. 

Example usage:

```python
from SROMPy.postprocess import Postprocessor
from SROMPy.srom import SROM
from SROMPy.target import NormalRandomVariable

#Initialize Normal random variable object to be modeled by SROM:
normal = NormalRandomVariable(mean=3., std_dev=1.5)

#Initialize SROM & optimize to model the normal random variable:
srom = SROM(size=10, dim=1)
srom.optimize(normal)

#Compare the CDF of the SROM & target normal variable:
post_processor = Postprocessor(srom, normal)
post_processor.compare_CDFs()
```
  
The above code snippet produces the following CDF comparison plot:
